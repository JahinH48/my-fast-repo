    <p>The green rosella (Platycercus caledonicus) is a parrot native to the Australian state of Tasmania and some Bass Strait
        islands. The species was described by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788. At up to 37 cm (14.5 in) 
       long, it is the largest species in its genus. Its underparts, neck and head are yellow, with a red band above the beak 
       and violet-blue cheeks. The back is mostly black and green, and its long tail blue and green. The female has duller 
       yellow plumage and more prominent red markings, as well as a smaller beak. Found in a wide range of habitats with some
        form of tree cover, the green rosella is predominantly herbivorous, consuming seeds, berries, nuts, fruits, and flowers,
        but it may also eat insect larvae and insects such as psyllids. Nesting takes place in tree hollows. The green rosella
        is widespread across Tasmania, but the King Island subspecies has been classed as vulnerable. (Full article...)
       Forty-eight archaeological materials or sets of materials from ancient to feudal Japan have been classified as National
        Treasures of Japan. The term has been used in the country to denote cultural properties since 1897; the definition and
        the criteria have changed since the introduction of the term. The listed archaeological materials adhere to the current
        definition, and have been designated National Treasures since the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties came 
       into effect on June 9, 1951. The materials, spanning a period from about 4500 BC to 1361 AD, were selected by the
        Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology based on their "especially high historical or artistic
        value". The actual number of items is more than forty-eight because groups of related objects have been combined into 
       single entries. Most of the items have been excavated from tombs, kofun, sutra mounds or other archaeological sites. </p>
